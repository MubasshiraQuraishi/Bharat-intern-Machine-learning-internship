Developed a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers, involving exploratory data analysis, multicollinearity checks using VIF, PCA dimensionality reduction, scaling, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and learning curve analysis. The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Logistic Regression models yielded promising results.

Crafted a wine quality prediction model, which included exploratory data analysis, dataset balancing, and model building.
